## About The Project
Finally, the time has come. I have been thinking about a portfolio site for long time but could not bring my ideas to life. Light bulb moment and there it is ! 

## Demo
Here is a [live demo ](https://myportfolioweb-site.netlify.app)

## How I worked on this project
- I built this website based on Figma designs:
  [Design](https://www.figma.com/file/Qndce9wgdOtMLjZZdTTKuQ/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)
- I was inspired by [this project](https://toyfight.co/work/toggl/). These guys are awesome.
  
## Why did I build the project this way ?
My personal opinion is that using a framework for a portfolio website is 'overkill'. That's one of the reasons I decided to use HTML, CSS(SASS), a bit of JS and Parcel bundler. It seems like a perfect combo for me.

I have seen many portfolios and a lot of them look very similar or have the same structure. I simply wanted to stand out and I had a lot of fun building it.

- I focused on sematic HTML, well organized styles (using SASS partials) and performance.
- All images have been optimized and lazy loaded.  
- I realise that in some sections, contrast is not perfect. Apart from that, I put a lot of effort into meeting accessibility standards. The website is easily to navigate using a keyboard. I did not include “Skip to Main Content” tool because it is a one-page site and users can quickly navigate through it. 

## What did I learn ?
First of all I have cemented my knowledge of web fundamentals. Secondly, I have discovered many new tools to check and improve websites's accessibility and performance. Lastly, time spent on building my portfolio gave me more confidence in my skills.
